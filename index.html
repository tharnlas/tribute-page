<p id="intro">In a period of racial segregation and (still persisting) gender bias in the STEM fields, Mary Jackson overcame the odds to become NASA's first black female engineer. She is one of the inspiring characters featured in the film <i>Hidden Figures</i>, which is based on Margot Lee Shetterly's 2016 novel, <i>Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Who Helped Win the Space Race</i>. Jackson's determination and dedication to fostering diversity in STEM is apparent throughout her lifework.</p>
